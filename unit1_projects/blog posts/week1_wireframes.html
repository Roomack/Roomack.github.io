					<h2>Week 1: Wireframes</h2>
		<br></br>
		<p>During week 1 of Phase 0, each of us were challenged to reverse engineer three of our favorite websites, and create wireframes to share with our cohort.  Mine are below!</p>

		<h3>Trulia</h3>

		  <br></br>
		  <p>The purpose of the Trulia site is to gather property listings from within a searchable area (city, neighborhood, etc.), and list them for prospective buyers/renters to choose from. The visual challenges for this site include: clearly displaying what the purpose of the site is, drawing the user's attention to an input box to gather necessary info, displaying the listings in an appealing, yet concise way. They accomplish this by locating the input field in the middle of large, relevant image at the top of the homepage.  Once the search criteria is entered by the user, the property listing are then displayed neatly, containing only the most necessary information.  
		  <p>------------------------</p>

		<h3>Skillcrush</h3>
		  <img src = "http://oi61.tinypic.com/33tkrc5.jpg" height=300 width=450/>
		  <br></br>
		  <p>Skillcrush.com is a company site which is used to market/advertise the training they offer for aspiring web developers and designers.  With all of the tech traffic they have through the site, the pressure to impress is that much higher! Skillcrush does a fantastic job of conquering its visual challenges, which include: how to present their products/services in a captivating way, and how to meet the user's high expectations for their site's design.  Skillcrush uses stunning backgrounds for its various pages, and ties in additional images in a way that is calm and fluid.  The color scheme for the various elements of the page draw attention to the more critical areas of the site without overwhelming the user.
		  <p>----------------</p>

		<h3>RealClearPolitics</h3>
		  <img src = "http://oi58.tinypic.com/seogt3.jpg" height=300 width=450/>
		  <br></br>
		  <p>Of the three sites, RCP has a purpose much different than the other two.  The goal of this site is to keep an up-to-date collection of the most popular editorials and news articles pertaining to recent current events.  Where other sites may need to "shock and awe" the user with stunning visual elements, RCP is more concerned with displaying the content in a clear, and organized fashion.  They do so by limiting the links for all articles to a single line, with consistent formatting for each link.  Links are also separated by timeframes and other various subcategories.  Considering the quantity of information contained on RCP, they've done a suitable job meeting their visual and content objectives.
