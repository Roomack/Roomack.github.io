					<h2>Kitchen v Restaurant</h2>
					<br></br>
		<p>While it's easy to see the technical gains that a student can make at DBC, the cultural knowledge is just as important.</p>
		<p>Students were asked to watch one of Shereef's "Fireside Chats", and answer a few questions regarding our expectations of the program, and ourselves...</p>

		<h3>What's your take on the DBC experience?</h3>
		<p>Buckle in and hold on! I expect DBC to be one of the most unique experiences of my life.  My comfort zone will be smashed by technical and cultural hammers. The only question is, what will I be when the pieces are put back together?... 

		<h3>What is your impression of DBC?</h3>
		<p>My impression of DBC is...wrong.  It will change - multiple times.  To me, DBC is one of those journeys that's so unique our minds can't predict it accurately.  For now, I believe DBC to be a alternative form  of learning.  People from all across the country congregate in one place, and proceed to eat, breathe, and $hit code.  DBC stretches your mind, slaps it in the face, and beats it against a keyboard until you can't take it.  "Hells yeah."
		
		<h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
		<p>As with any new environment, adapting to DBC will be a huge adjustment.  Luckily, my professional career has taught me much about thinking outloud, communicating my thoughts, and considering others' point of view.  With that said, most of my academic career has followed the tyipcal model: sit, listen, test.  I'm open-minded though, and I applied to DBC for a reason.
		
		<h3>Have your expectations of DBC changed, and how?</h3>
		<p>Admittedly, my initial interest in DBC came from more of a "restaurant/consumer" mentality.  My current job was going nowhere, and I wanted a fix.  After applying the first time I was rejected (luckily), and my approach is much more inline with the "kitchen" mentality.  This program will be what WE MAKE IT.  Not only must I make commitments each day when walk into DBC, but all of my peers must as well.  This isn't every man for himself.
		Sit. Listen. Test? Psh....
		How about: GET UP! TALK THROUGH IT! CREATE!</p>

		<h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?</h3>
		<p>Excited? No.  F***ing ecstatic? YES.  
		I've been looking forward to this program for over a year, and my excitement has only strengthened.  The challenges, students, and instructors are already making this a wild ride.
		<h3>Does it make you nervous?</h3>
		<p>Hmmmm...Spending my life savings, quitting my job, and moving across the country to live/work with complete strangers.  If you're not at least a little nervous, you must have ice water running through your veins.  I'm certainly nervous, but in a good way.  Much of DBC is unpredictable, and that's what I signed up for.  Keep the adrenaline coming!</p>
