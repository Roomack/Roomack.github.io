			<p>In any group learning environment, there are a variety of personal factors at play as you interact with one another, and these factors that can often lead to conflict.  In Week 8, DBC has asked us to consider a conflict from out past, and use the Compass of Shame to understand the causes and effects of that situation.</p>

			<h3>The Compass of Shame</h3>

			<p>Developed by Dr. L. Nathanson, the diagram above is meant to demonstrate the four different defensive directions that we often take when we are having difficulty processsing conflict.  Understand that defensive directions are not ALWAYS the response, as someone with sufficient self-esteem and maturity are often capable of reacting to conflict in a positive way.  Also, keep in mind that it's possible to react with a combination of the directions listed above, depending upon the situation.

			<h3>Discuss an emotional conflict you've had.  What was it about?</h3>

			<p>I've spent the last eight years in a managerial roles which have obviously present a fair share of situational conflicts.  In my current job, I recently had an ongoing conflict with another manager who had been demeaning my office team through body language, tone of voice, and disrespectful demands.  What complicated this situation further was the fact that the manager in question was a superior whom I directly reported to, and I was also new to the company, and the position.</p>

			<h3>What was the source of the conflict?</h3>
			<p>The manager's negative treatment of the employees in my department was impacting their own morale and performance.  As the department manager, I'm responsible for representing my team (especially to a superior), and I took offense to his tactics.</p>

			<p>Initially I let my "rookie" status get the best of me, and I took the avoidance route in handling the conflict.  This was partly due to my lack of familiarity with the unique "politics" of this specific workplace, and also my fear of engaging my boss about such an awkward topic.  Eventually I realized that avoiding this conflict was not going to provide any sort of resolution, and that the morale of my team would continue to degrade until they either filed a complaint with HR or simply quit.</p>

			<p>My first approach was fairly subtle, and failed to bring about any substantive change in his behavior.  His reaction was very non-chalant, and I felt as though he wasn't taking me seriously.  After waiting another couple of weeks, I decided to take a much firmer approach.  I asked to speak with him one on one on a timetable that I set (not him), and we held the discussion in MY office (not his).  Insted of hinting at the issue and beating around the bush, I went straight to the point.  I did not lecture him, but instead chose to ask questions.  "How do you think they feel? Do you think that is appropriate? How do you respond when your boss talks to you like that?"  After I felt that we had made some progress, I capped off the conversation by stating that he was setting an unprofessional tone, and that when I was interviewed he told me that "he led by example, and wanted to hire someone that would do the same."  Once he acknowledged that comment, and I made it clear that he was failing me.</p>

			<h3>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h3>
			<p>After our second discussion, the entire team noticed a change in his behavior (though gradual).  The demeaning comments came to an end overall, and he even tried to make up for his mistakes by bringing in food for the team on a couple of different occasions.</p>

			<h3>If you could go back, what would you do differently?</h3>
			<p> I would have addressed the issue more quickly, and not used my short tenure with the company as an excuse to not do what I thought was right.  I would have also been more firm in my approach during my FIRST conversation with him considering the importance of the issue.</p>

			<h3>What did you learn from this experience?</h3>
			<p>I've had an eight year managment career and dealt with dozens of workplace conflicts.  Despite that experience, I still took a defensive direction in the example above that failed to resolve the disagreement (initially).  With that,  a learning lesson here is that regardless of our experience in handling conflicts, we'll continue to be tested throughout our lives with new, unique circumstances we haven't experienced before.  Its imperative that we recognize the defensive reactions that each of us resorts to when a disagreement arises, and maintain a growth mindset when trying to develop our own ability to resolve conflicts more maturely.</p>
