					<h2>Dissecting the Stereotype Threat</h2>

			<p>For our sixth week, the topic that our cohort was tasked with researching was that of the "Stereotype Threat".  Before I even attempt to describe this threat to you, I encourage you to consider the following questions:</p>
			
			
			  <p>Have you ever felt "different" than everyone else?</p>
			  <p>How did this feeling impact your behavior?</p>
			  <p>How did this feeling impact your self-esteem?</p>
			  <p>Were you "justified" in having this feeling to begin with?</p>
			

			<p>Being that the theory of stereotype threat is just that, a theory, there is no official definition.  However, Wikipedia defines it as the following:</p>

			<p>It's likely that we have all had this feeling at some point, considering that each of us is, in one way or another, part of a minority group.  We're accustomed to thinking of minority groups as based on race, religion, or sexual orientation, but a minority group can be any size collection of people that share a common interest or quality.</p>

			<p>As I read through the various literature on the subject, I couldn't help but think of my own life experiences with regard to stereotypes, their impact on my behavior, and what conclusions I have drawn...</p>

			<p>Whenever we first meet someone, it's likely that one of our initial questions will be "Where are you from?"  A person's origin says a lot about them, and for the questioner, it can provide insight as to what this person may be like.  While many of us are often passionate about telling others that we're "proud of where we're from", our fear of what they may assume about our origins can easily open the door to the stereotype threat.</p>

			<p>This is just as true for myself, considering I'm from the state of Kansas.  As I've traveled the country and lived in other states, I've occasionally come across stereotypical comments about the Mid-West/Kansas.  These comments come in a variety of forms, but often insenuate that midwesterners aren't educated, or that we "live in the past".</p>


			<p>While much of the time there is certain sarcasm layered into these conversations, I must be honest in admitting that they can still get to me.  It's not that I view myself as an uneducated person, but my fear of fulfilling the stereotype can impact how I think I should act in some situations.  "Okay Andrew, don't say anything stupid or too "Kansasy" in front everyone".  Or, "Avoid comments about country music, pick-up trucks, and wheat fields!".</p>     

			<p>This feeling can also become amplified with regard to my accent.  While most tell me that it isn't that strong, there are some who instantly pick it up, and then immitate me as our conversation carries on.  I don't believe that they are intentionally mocking me (as accents are an easy conversation starter), but again, depending on the situation I can take offense, and then catch myself trying to speak in a more "normal" tongue.</p>

			<p>A more recent example of my falling victim to the stereotype threat has been related to my transition into a career in technology.  Kansas is hardly a mecca for tech innovation, and the more popular tech-hubs like San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and Portland can often overshadow smaller, yet still relevant tech communities (such as Kansas City).</p>  

			<p>Yet again, this can make me feel as though I have something to prove to my peers.  That I, alone, must show everyone that Kansas can produce a world-class web developer!  A little friendly competition never hurt!  Well, this friendly competition is motivational, but only up to a certain point.  During Phase 0, there have been many moments where I wasn't grasping a particular concept.  And again, I must admit that I began doubting my own abilities because of the stereotype threat.  "I'm the only one in my class from Kansas - this can't be coincidence." Or, "I'm not cut out for this - I didn't grow up in a booming tech city."</p>

			<p>As I dissect my reactions to these situations, it comes with it some positive introspection.  Stereotypes are undoubtedly a reality, but how we react to them is entirely up to us.  Hearing one comment from a single individual should not be reason to assume that an entire group feels the same way.</p> 

			<p> What exacerbates this problem is the fact that my generation has gradually become more and more known for its sarcasm.  Humor seems to seep its way into almost any situation, and our enjoyment of mocking well-known stereotypes can have the inadvertent effect of strengthening the threat they pose to each of us (in our own minds).</p>

			<p>Furthermore, as we become increasingly connected by technology, we're more likely to hear "horror stories" of someone in our minority group facing discrimination.  To break through the stereotype threat, I try to remind myself that these are the opinions of the few, and that a majority of the people we interact with respect and appreciate our unique differences.  The world isn't out to get us!  Whether for race, origin, sexual orientation, etc., we let our fear of what we don't know grow inside our own minds.  This not only limits our achievements, but also lets the truly ignorant bullies out there increase their impact on our lives.</p>

			<p> And then there's DBC: a program made up of students from a vast array of backgrounds, interests, and ethnicities.  The stereotype threat is built upon fear, and what better way to conquer a fear than to stare it square in the eye.  We're all uncertain and insecure, but luckily, this experience will force all of us into a situation where we must depend on, tolerate, and thrive off of our differences.  I look forward to day one, when I can introduce myself to the class and say, "Hello, I'm Andrew, I'm from Kansas, and I'm here to become a web developer."</p>
