			<p>In Week 7, we've been challenged to consider what our "values" are, whether we live them, and how we can use those values to help us succeed at DBC:</p>

			<h3>When you think of the times in your life where you've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</h3>
			<p>Self-Respect, Sympathy, and Growth</p>

			<h3>Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.</h3>
			<p>A value that I consistently try to abide by is that of having sympathy for others regardless of the situation.  We have each experienced our own lives through unique circumstances and events which have created the people that we are today.  Having an understanding of that fact is critical in maintaining sympathy for one another, and also allows us to find common ground where it may otherwise have not existed.</p>

			<h3>Answer the following for the values you chose in Exercise 1:</h3>

			<h3>In general, I try to live up to these values:</h3>

			<h3>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</h3>

			<p> *5* It's worth noting that we can all "try" to live our values, but we must also recognize our failures in this effort so that we can continue to live them more closely.</p>

			<h3>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</h3>

			<p>The last topic a firend asked me for advice on was regarding their employment situation.  A very close friend of mine has worke at the same job for several years now, and despite their constant praise and promotion promises, they have yet to deliver.  Coincidentally, I notce that the advice I gave him a few days ago ties in closely with the values that I listed above.</p>

			<p>The lack of tangible appreciation for his hard work had begun to damage his own self-respect in that he was feeling unworthy and "not good enough".  Furthermore, with his hopes of a promotion quickly fading, he also fel that he was no longer "growing".  He had a desire to learn and do more, but they were not recognizing his talent enough to grant him that responsibility.</p>

			<p>It's no surprise that my advice to him (after exhausting some other options), was to consider moving onto another company that could better boost his self-respect AND his personal growth.</p>

			<h3>How do you feel when you think about your values?</h3>

			<p>At age 28 I find that my values are becoming more important to me than ever.  The need for status/material things is diminishing, and I want to better impact the lives of those around me.  I believe that by continuing to prioritize my own growth, respect, and sympathy for others I can more positively enhance that impact.</p>  

			<h3>Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?</h3>
			<p>Without a doubt.  The three values I listed profoundly influence our falling victim to stereotype threat.  Respecting ones self is key to breaking through the walls of stereotypes and smashing your own fear.  Prioritizing your growth leads to additional motivation in ignoring the tricks your own mind may play on you with regard to what "others think".  Lastly, having sympathy for others will also help you better understand someone else's inability to repel the stereotype threat.</p>

			<h3>Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?</h3>
			<p>Whenever I feel that I'm doubting myself, I've found a very helpful excercise in lifting my own self-esteem.  It ironically involves thinking about my past FAILURES.  Yes - FAILURES.  Not to dwell upon them, but to consider how I have turned so many failures into successes, and how much credit I should give myself for the various things I've accomplished in my life.  In fact, on the front of my programming binder I keep a copy of my rejection letter from DBC (from the first time I applied).  I was heartbroken, and for a short while thought that web development may not be a field I could break into.  Well...look at me now :) </p>
