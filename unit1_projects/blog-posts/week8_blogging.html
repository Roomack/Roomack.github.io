				<p>Until I entered Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp, my blogging experience was...non-existent.  In fact, I hadn't done much reflective writing other than a few Facebook posts since I left college several years ago.  Admittedly, I was a little resistant to the idea of blogging as it seemed to be a lot of work for not much technical gain.  Do you ever look back and think, "How was I so ignorant?" </p>

				<p>The wealth of knowledge I've accumulated in just eight weeks at DBC has been astonishing.  I'm creating websites, debugging programs, and solving the world's problems with nothing more than a mouse (okay, maybe not), and it rocks.  With my work history being focused mostly on the non-technical, gaining these very technical skills is a fresh pitcher of cold water thrown in my face.  But as my skills on the computer improve, I have hardly left the non-technical part of brain behind.  In fact, I'm finding that my "soft" skills are just as critical to my success at becoming a web developer, which certainly includes reflecting about my learning through writing (my blog).</p>

				<p>Simply put, the act of blogging has been priceless.  First, writing a blog about recent knowledge that you've gained solidifies your understanding of the subject to a much greater degree.  As we all know, it is one thing to think you understand something, and another to be able to articulate that knowledge and give it to someone who has no prior experience with the topic.  Writing is teaching, and teaching is learning, hence why blogging can grow all skills - even the technical ones.</p>

				<p>Another gain to blogging is that it gives you a record of your learning experiences which you can return to for reference later on.  Let's get real, DBC forces an immense amount of info into your brain, and it's impossible to retain EVERYTHING.  "What was absolute positioning again? Oh yeah, I wrote a blog about that back in week 3." Or, "Hmmmm.....when should I use modules in my program? Ahh - week 6!"</p>

				<p>But having a record of what you've learned isn't only advantageous for the material itself, but as a point of reference to see how much you've grown!  There's no greater motivation than to see "the old you" through your writing.  Topics you were unfamiliar with, concepts you didn't understand, and misconceptions you had provide great fuel to your fire for growth as you can see what you've accomplished over just a few weeks.  After all, you don't know where you're going until you know where you're at!</p>  

				<p>I have no doubt that my confidence going into Phase 1 of DBC wouldn't be nearly as strong if I hadn't maintained a quality blog to document my journey.  I definitely see the value to scribing my thoughts, and realize that there is seems to always be a method to DBC's madness :)</p>
