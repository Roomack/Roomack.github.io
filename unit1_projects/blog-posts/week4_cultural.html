		<p>It's okay. You can come out.  There's nothing to be afraid of!</p>

			<p>As technology evolves and continues to connect us in ways we never thought possible, so too does the skillset that tech companies are looking for in their "ideal" candidates.  For the longest time, the stereotyipical tech employee was a reclusive, video-game loving, people-fearing, anxiety-ridden computer "geek". And while many stereotypes are exaggerated and unfair, I think it's safe to say that we've all had a friend or two that fit that description in one way or another!</p>

			<p>As in any business, communication is often the biggest problem hindering performance, morale, and the bottom line.  The tech sector is no different.  Just walk through an office with cubicles, and you'll see why it's no wonder that communication is an issue.  Too many companies separate their employees into these identical, soul-sucking, solitary confinement chambers.  You can quite literally work the entire day without seeing a coworker.  The negative consequences of this separation cannot be overstated.  The psychological effects of physical barriers have been proven time and time again to become barriers for communication.  What do the best teams do when their tackling a task? They huddle up! They create open lines of communication that allow for free expression and brainstorming.  They don't give themselves an excuse to become isolated, and they REMOVE barriers.</p>  

			<p>But while cubicles are the easy elephant to see in the room, the true root cause of any communication problem lies in the people doing the communicating (or lack there of).  For far too long, tech companies seeking engineers, developers, and programmers have focused mainly on an applicant's hard skills.  Can they code? Check. Are they efficient? Check.  HIRED!</p>

			<p>While this type of candidate is usually capable of completing the tasks necessary for their job, their lack of personal (soft) skills can become a growing problem that will eventually show itself.  Sure, they can refactor a program like nobody's business, but can they rally a team together when the going gets tough?  Can they motivate those around them to continue performing better?  Are they not just concerned about their own well-being, but that of the people working with them on a daily basis? If not, this newly hired asset could soon become a liability in more ways than one.  And the potential for disaster is high if it turns out to be one of the "rotten apples" that can become poison for an office.</p>

			<p>So how do tech companies begin to solve this problem?  They've already begun, but there's still plenty of room to run:</p>

			<p>First, employers must heighten the importance of screening candidates that have soft AND hard skills.  They carry equal weight (depending on the position),
			 and are critical to a companies success as development projects become larger and more collaborative.  Growing a company starts with interviews, but many managers tend to rush through these critical meetings because interviews can be....awkward.  Think about it.  You've just met this person for the first time, and over the course of an hour or two you're going to agree to begin spending 40-50 hrs/week together for an indefinite amount of time.  That's pressure!  But, also all the more reason why this time should be spent wisely, and not just on a white-board.  By spending more time focused on a candidate's communication skills, employers will make wiser investments for their own future, and also pave the way for new managers who can screen for the same in future candidates.</p>

			 <p>Another solution to this problem is the increasing success of programs like DBC.  If you remember your application to the program, you'll recall that getting accepted didn't come down to just coding a few challenges.  DBC wants team-players who can communicate, share their feelings, be honest, and collaborate willingly!  Not all bootcamps abide by the same prerequisites, but as DBC's success continues to grow, they'll likely see the benefits of graduating students with a mind for logic, and personality for working well with others.</p>

			 <p>Perhaps one of the most simple answers to improving open dialogue in the office is TEAR DOWN THE CUBICLES!  In my current position as budget manager for a transportation company, my boss spent time with me on my vey first day to discuss concerns he had about the team I would be leading.  They were unapproachable, abrasive, and "detached from the operation".  After a few days I could tell that this was not an exaggeration, and I began to think of ways I could improve the situation.  My answer? I came into work early on a Monday morning, and I removed the cubicle dividers between their desks entirely.  Aside from losing some prime calendar hanging real-estate, the decision was a net positive for several reasons:</p>

			 	<p>  Their communication improved because they could actually talk to one another (instead of a wall)</p>
			   
			   	<p>Their teamwork improved because they could read their coworkers body language and feel their emotions more accurately.</p>

			   	<p>Their morale improved because they stopped resorting to email as their primary means of communication.</p>
				
			<p>Lastly, I believe that technology itself will become its own solution to this problem.  With the frequencey of video calls via FaceTime, Google Hangout, and Skype becoming more and more common, employees won't be able to hide behind their keyboards any longer.  We're creating more effective means of communication all the time, and this connectivity between employees will undoubetdly improve their ability to share ideas, feelings, and concerns more openly and regularly than in the days before video-conferencing.</p>

			<p>In summary, the next time someone in the office asks why people aren't thinking outside of the box, politely point out that it may be because they're working inside one!</p>
