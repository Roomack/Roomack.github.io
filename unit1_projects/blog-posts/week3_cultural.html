					<h2>How I Eat My Food For Thought</h2>

		<p>Have you ever asked yourself, "How do I think?" It may seem like a silly question on the surface, but as you begin any new learning experience (especially one as intense as DBC), it's probably one of the most important questions you'll ever ask.  While were accustomed to focusing on WHAT we'll be learning, and WHEN we'll be learning it, the "HOW" is often left alone to drift along without much attention.  Before you ever crack open a text book or load an online tutorial, consider this: How do you best absorb knowledge, and how can you impact your own learning by having that awareness? </p>

		<h3>My Gregorc Thinking Style</h3>
			<br>
			
		<p>One of our first assignments during the prep period at DBC was to research our "Gregorc Thinking Style."  It was a fairly simple assignment, but for someone who is about to begin a knowledge bombardment program, it was also an interesting one.  First, we had to answer a series of questions on how we think we learn best.  Our answers to those questions are then used to determine which of four thinking styles our brains are most likely to possess.  For me, that style was "Concrete Sequential".  Afte reading the description, I was not at all shocked:

			<br>
			<br>

			<p>So as I move forward through DBC, I try to occasionally look back at this list and be cognizant of HOW I learn.  Inherently, these leads to more questions...
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
		<h3>What Are My Biggest Hurdles in Phase 0?</h3>

			<br>
			
		<p>Thus far in Phase 0, my biggest hurdle has undoubtedly been my ability to juggle a full-time job with my online coursework for DBC.  It's tough.  And while at first I thought my own thinking style was fairly irrelevant to this problem, I now realize that's not the case.  That is because my thinking style applies to all areas of my life, not just school but also my job.  I've found that if I can help myself to absorb knowledge more effectively while at work, I'll therefore free up more time to focus on DBC as well.  My brain is drawn to things with logical order and predictability, so I've begun to structure my work day/studies accordingly.  For new information I'm trying to learn, I first create outlines to paint a high-level picture of what I'm up against.  I also maintain detailed to-do lists with timeframes and status updates to limit the "unpredictable."</p>

		<p>While the gains have hardly been gigantic, I've noticed that some of these small changes have noticeably improved my ability to handle both priorities over the last three weeks.  By the end of the first week I was drowning.  I'm still coughing up a bit of water, but I'm alive and kicking in week 3 :)</p>

			<h3>Growth vs Fixed Mindset</h3>

		<br>
	

		<p>Another task that the students were assigned was to read an article entitled "Growth vs. Fixed Mindset".  The article essentially explained the two different approaches that the human mind can take towards learning and development.</p>

		<p>Someone with a "growth" mindset approaches challenges eagerly and faces their fears with the goal of conquering them.  They accept feedback and incorporate it in order to help themselves grow.</p>

		<p>On the flip-side, someone with a "fixed" mindset often approaches challenges with hesitance, afraid to fail.  This leads to avoiding the very experiences which help the mind to grow.  This mindset also prevents a person from taking constructive feedback positively, which also limits growth.</p>

		<p>While most of us would like to say that we consistently have a "growth" mindset, that is most likely not the case.  It's also important to remember that it is possible for someone to have a combination of these two mindsets, which may be dependent on the learning situation.  I readily acknowledge that my brain will shift between these two mindsets, and it is sometimes hard for me to predict my approach (which is okay!).  I suppose the greatest lesson I took from this article is that whenever I face a new challenge, I should try to consider what mindset I'm forming as I consider my next step.  Am I engaged and ready to grow, or am I holding myself back?  Why?  I encourage you to do the same, and don't be afraid to recognize your "fixed" moments, because we've all got 'em!
