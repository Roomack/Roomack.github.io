		<p>Oh how we take things for granted. Especially when it comes to interacting with the webpages we know and love online.  Have you ever started filling out a form online, and all of a sudden an "annoying" little error message pops up, only to tell you that you've filled in something incorrectly?  Or have your eyes ever been entertained by some element of the page that is animated?  These little pieces of candy are all brought to us through the power of JavaScript.</p>

		<p>Frequently referred to as JS, this programming language has exploded in popularity in recent years, and is used in the development of countless webpages/applications.  While its functions are many, JS is what allows features of a webpage to update without having to reload the entire page.  While at first this may seem trivial, this significantly improves the user experience!  But it doesn't stop there.  Continue reading to understand why JS has become one of the most critical (and powerful) weapons in the developer utility belt.  

		<h3>Everybody wants some!</h3>
		  <p>So, why is JS so popular?  For one thing, it's an incredibly dynamic language, and can be used for multiple purposes and to create a variety of programs for use online.  While it is typically related to client-side programming, its popularity has also grown in server-side programming through platforms such as Node.js.  Not to mention, it's easy to learn, with countless resources available in print/online to teach even the most inexperienced rookie.  What's better than having a tool that has tremendous value and can be used by almost anyone?  
		  </p>

		  <p>Due to the reasons I've mentioned, JavaScript's popularity continues to build on itself.  In fact, JS is now built into all modern web browsers, and is also supported by a majority of mobile/tablet browsers.  This makes for an impressive online presence, and with that comes the advent of new tools to enhance JavaScript's power even further. </p>

		<h3>The best it has to offer...</h3>
		  <p>With a near 20 year existence, JS has continued to grown and develop over the years as any other language would.  New versions, enhancements, and support tools are being released on a regular basis, which keeps the language fresh and efficient.</p> 

		  <p>Initially, using JS wasn't as painless as it is today.  Writing functions in the language required long bits of code that were difficult to understand and hard to replicate. Luckily, the advent of JS libraries such as jQuery have helped us to solve problems and write programs using JS much easier.  What has also become easier is debugging the language.  If you have ever written a computer program, you know how tedious it can be trying to search for the smallest of errors contained inside pages of code.  There are now resources such as Chrome Dev Tools which help developers to isolate syntax errors and also maximize the ability of their code to enhance interactivity with the user.</p>

		<h3>But it ain't perfect...</h3>

		<p> There's always room for improvement, right?  While its easy to see all of the benefits of JavaScript, it has its drawbacks like any other language.  First and foremost is security.  JS typically runs on the client-side, which presents many different security concerns with regard to exposing your personal computer to danger.  Because of these concerns, JS's functions are intentionally limited to keep the user safe.  These limits, as well as some other unrelated limitations include:</p>

		<ul>
			<li> Inability to access databases (without assistance from other scripts) </li>
			<li> Inability to modify files stored on the client (protection) </li>
			<li> Inability to access web pages hosted on another domain </li>
			<li> Inconsistent interpretation by different web browsers </li>
		</ul>

		<p>Nonetheless, JavaScript will undoubtedly to continue to strengthen its presence on the web, and with that will come ever-improving funtionality and impact on user experience.  The question is, can you handle it!?
