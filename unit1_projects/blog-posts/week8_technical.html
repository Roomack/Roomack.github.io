			<h2>What is Rails?</h2>

			<p>As with most topics related to programming, you must first understand one subject before you can understand another, and Rails is no different! Before we begin breaking down the uses of Rails and why it is so popular, let's take a look at GitHub's simple definition of the Rails framework:</p>

			<br>
			<p>If you're scratching your head, you're not alone.  Rails cannot simply be understood by reading a simple definition, so let's dig in further!</p>
			<p>------------------------</p>

			<h3>Getting to Know Ruby</h3>

			<p>Whenever you first meet someone, a popular first question to ask of that person is, "Where are you from?" To understand someone's (something's) origin is to better understand that person/thing itself.  With that, Rails is a framework that is written in the Ruby programming language.  Just in case you're unfamiliar with Ruby, it is an object-oriented, general-purpose programming language.  Created over 20 years ago by Yukihiro Matsumoto, Ruby's popularity has grown immensely and is now one of the top 10 programming languages out there with regard to web programming.  It is a dynamic language, popular because it can accomplish tasks using less code as compared to its programming cousins (Java, C++, etc.), and it can be learned more quickly than other languages as well.</p>

			<h3>Enter: Rails</h3>
			<br>

			<br>
			<p>So where does Ruby tie in with all of this?  According to the <em>RailsApp Project</em>, Rails is a "software library that extends the Ruby programming language", or "software code that is added to the Ruby programming language" (hence the often used phrase "Ruby on Rails").  With Ruby's already existent awesomeness, using Rails to "extend" its greatness opens many doors with regard to our ability to build equally awesome websites! Just think of Ruby on Rails as Ruby on <strong>Steroids!</strong></p>

			<p>As I stated above, Ruby on Rails is used in the development of web applications.  How does a framework benefit a developer as they're creating a new app?  I'm a big fan of analogies, so let's use a slightly crude one to orchestrate the benefit of Rails.  Imagine you are wanting to build a new deck on the side of your house.  Before getting started, you'd need to draw up plans, purchase and organize your tools, and hire some good help (or borrow a brother-in-law) to help with the heavy lifting.  Wouldn't it be great if you could have all of those steps done FOR YOU?  That's what Rails accomplishes for a web developer.  It helps organize your development tools (Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS), gives you a loose framework to start with, and also helps you out with some of the heavy lifting along the way!</p>

			<p>More technically speaking, it is "opinionated" software that encourages the developer to abide by certain suggestions and conventions contained within the Rails <strong>API</strong> (Application Programming Interface).  This API can be viewed as a rulebook which standardizes the use of Rails.  This standardization allows for better collaboration between developers, and paves the way for more focused resources for maintaining and improving the framework itself.</p>  

			<p>------------------------</p>

			<h3>The MVC Pattern</h3>

			<p>Let's take another look at the Rails description I gave you earlier:</p>
			<br>
			<img src = "http://oi60.tinypic.com/acwrcz.jpg" height = 100 width = 700/>
			<br>
			<p>The <strong>Model - View - WHO</strong>?  To truly understand Rails, you'll need to also understand (recurring theme here, right?) the <strong>M</strong>odel-<strong>V</strong>iew-<strong>C</strong>ontroller (MVC) pattern.  MVC essentialls splits up your application intro three sections, or "layers", giving each individual sections it's own specific responsibility. 

			<p>The <strong>model</strong> is essentially the central hub for all of the application's data and rules.</p>

			<p>The <strong>view</strong> refers to any form of output to the user.</p>

			<p>The <strong>controller</strong> is responsible for accepting input from the user and converting into commands for the model/view. 

			<p>Based on the graphic below, you can see that these three components interact with one another as the application is being used, and allow the app to change with the user's direction/input.  As you can see, this pattern is critical to the operation of the application, and explains why so many frameworks (like Rails) are geared towards MVC.</p>

			<p>------------------------</p>

			<h3>A Parting Thought...</h3>

			<p>As you might have guessed, we've only scratched the surface when it comes to Ruby on Rails, but much of the knowledge that remains (as with most programming concepts) is best acquired through hands-on-practice.  At this point, you at least have an understanding of "WHAT" and "WHY" Rails is, which only leaves the "HOW".  So do some googling, a little bit of downloading, and a lot of programming so that you can add Rails to your resume with confidence!</p>
