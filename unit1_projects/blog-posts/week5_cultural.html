		<p>"Alright class, I'm going to separate you all into small groups so that we can begin our next group project."  Those words are heard in every classroom at some point, and the typical response from students is length groan or sigh followed by a hesitant compliance to their teacher's instructions.  There was always something about group projects that seem to suck the life out of a room, and for many different reasons.  Perhaps you weren't comfortable working with others, or maybe you felt intimidated by your peers and didn't want them to see how "dumb" you really were.Or maybe you were a perfectionist, and you let your own need to control the project trap you into doing all of the work.  Whatever the reason may be, teachers had good cause in pairing/grouping you with other students.  The purpose?  To break you out of your COMFORT ZONE! To force you to learn from others, and accept different viewpoints that you may not agree with.  Why has Dev Bootcamp been successful?  It is built upon this foundation...</p>

		<p>Luckily, in my management career I've learned to embrace working with others to achieve any goal.  No matter how intelligent or resourceful you may think you are, there is no denying that two heads are quite often better than one.  With two people, you get twice the experience, twice the resources, and often twice the knowledge.  So with the multiple benefits of pairing to solve problems, why are we so hesitant to do so at times?  

		<p>Communication.</p>

		<p>We are frustrated when we can't communicate our thoughts correctly, and this inability to communicate can leave us feeling inferior, or worse...superior.  "Why don't they understand what I'm saying!?"  "Why can't I explain myself the right way!?"  These are our internal responses when our team lacks cohesion or isn't achieving the task at hand.  It becomes an informal blame game, with their being no true winners at the end.  Unless, something magical happens.  The team BREAKS THROUGH BARRIERS.  They try new ways of communicating, and dig down into the specifis of why their progress is falling short.Again, this is what sets DBC apart from other schools.  It has found the bread and butter of colaboration, and from the day you begin in Phase 0, you begin partnering with the other members of your cohort to work on challenges.  Whether you like it or not, you're going to collaborate.</p>

		<p>I remember my first pairing session and how awkward I was worried the interactions would be.  Not only did I have little programming experience, but I was also new to using Google Hangout/Skype.</p>

		<p>"How should I dress?"</p>  
		<p>"When should I speak?"</p>
		<p>"Do I need to raise my hand!?" </p>

		<p>Boy was I worried about all the wrong things!  After my first session was complete, I walked away feeling surprising optimistic about my other sessions moving forward.  It was actually beneficial? Who would have thought?  From a technical standpoint, having a partner there to work through the challenge likely saved each of hours in research.  The knowledge we each had accented the other's, and it was fun to see us fit together the pieces of the puzzle together.  A greater benefit to the video chat however, was the impact it had on my personal relationship with the student.  Rather than being stuck in the office with my head buried in tutorials, I was speaking to a live human being, and making a friend while we simultaneously conquered code. Kick-ass!</p>

		<p>Now have multiple pairing sessions under my belt, and I can honestly say that my support of this tactic is only stronger.  My comfortability in asking questions has grown, my ability to articulate my thoughts has expanded, and most importantly I have been reminded that MY way may not always be the BEST way. Priceless.  While we may not always see eye to eye, web development is all about collaboration, and this is real experience for the real world.  Your ability to work with others is critical to your success with any company, on any project.  DBC recognizes that, and they have gifted us with an academic model that smashes the convetional wisdom of classroom learning.</p>

		<p>What DBC has done to further grown the benefits of this learning model is to mandate that student offer feedback to their partners.  This feedback gives the program consistent integrity, and encourages growth by all students.  Another reason that we fear working with others is that we are actually intimidated by their feedback.  In our minds, we all too often jump to our own defense, and the only way to conquer this default reaction is through practice.</p>
		<p>"They don't know me well enough to give me feedback."</p>
		<p>"What good is her opinion anyway?"</p>
	  	<p>To truly grow, you have to break down the walls you've built up against criticism, and that is impossible without continuing to listen to the feedback of others.</p>

		<p>As I've read through the feedback that students have given me on my own pairing sessions, I've found that they actually make me feel much BETTER about my contributions.  I can be my own harshest critic most of the time, and to see their kind, actionable, and specific feedback is positive reinforcment that I could have never felt learning on my own.  To hear compliments such as: "you're a great listener", or "I learned so much from working with you" is amazing.  Furthermore, the constructive feedback is just as important.  While we never like to hear that we've done something wrong, becoming comfortable with your imperfection can be a reward in itself!  Hiding our flaws is not conducive to growth, and the feedback system at DBC (when executed properly) is critical in helping us each target areas where we can improve.</p>
		<p>I've also found that writing feedback for others helps my own growth.  In having to articulate what I enjoyed or did not enjoy about my partner's contributions, it forces me to think about my own role from their perspective.  Feedback helps you to identify double standards that you may have in place, and highlights any unfair expectations that you may have of another student.  Through this identification, it effectively brings out your kindness as you realize that you wouldn't want to be judged unfairly either.</p>

		<p>DBC is not a perfect program, nor does it claim to be.  Time and time again we are told that it is up to US to make this a successful tool in our lives.  Pairing and feedback are no different.  Collaboration and communication are key to success in any job, and only more so with regard to web development.  If each student is willing to prioritize their openness for growth (and openness to being wrong), the positive impacts of DBC are limitless.  Then, and only then have we taken full advantage of this remarkable experience.</p>
