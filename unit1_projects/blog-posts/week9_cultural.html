			<h2>Questioning Your Questions</h2>

			<p>As a developer (creator), you're probably quite familiar with how easy it is to obsess over your finished product.  You've spent countless hours tweaking, polishing, modifying, and cleaning a project that is near and dear to your developer soul, and your desire for perfection in presenting it to the world is insurmountable.  With that, have you ever considered how many questions you had to ask in creating that project?  How many times did you have to solicit the help of others in working through the various obstacles you encountered?</p>

			<p>Asking questions in an inherent part of the design process, and moving forward you should make it a regular practice of questioning your questions!  Writing clear and relevant questions can make a world of difference with regard to the answers you'll receive, and the simple truth is that the better the questions you ask, the better a developer you will become.</p>

			<h3>Who Is Your Question For?</h3>
			<br>

			<p>Before you even begin to worry about how to ask your question, put considerable thought into WHO the question is intended for.  Knowing your audience is paramount to successfully communicating in any situation, and posting to technical sites is no different.</p>

			<p>For example, you may looking for help with a general concept that could be answered by almost anyone, so you decide to post it to a "beginner-level" help site.  If that's the case, you may want to speak in a more non-technical fashion so as not to confuse readers.  Alternatively, your question may pertain to a much more advanced technical subject, in which event you'll want to be sure to use appropriate and specific terminology that paints a clear picture to the experts you are hoping to connect with.</p>

			<p>If anything, pretend that you are the one trying to answer your question.  Put yourself in the reader's shoes, and think about what information YOU would need to have an easy time providing an answer.  Remember, your audience has no background information about your problem other than what you provide!</p>  
			
			<h3>What Should Your Question Contain?</h3>

			<img src = "http://blog.brand-yourself.com/wp-content/uploads/Relevance.png" height=425 width=400/>

			<p>Short answer: RELEVANT INFORMATION ONLY!</p>

			<p>To capture the attention of your readers, it is critical that your question is to the point, and doesn't contain any unnecessary information.  Imagine if movie titles were several sentences long, or contained info that didn't pertain to the subject of the film.  Would you still go?  Humans have short attention spans, and you should be cognizant of that as you post questions online.</p> 

			<p>The most important element of your question will likely be the title.  Being that the title is the first thing your readers will see, they should be specific, and as concise as possible.  You should assume that whoever is reading it is likely in a hurry, and has plenty of other things they could be doing.  Make it worth their time, as you would expect the same of them.  Try not to be too broad or vague, as this can be confusing and will likely lead to you receiving just as vague an answer (if any at all).</p>

			<p>As you've searched around on various tech help sites (such as Stack Overflow), you've probably noticed that the questioners often include code snippets to paint a clearer picture of their problem.  This is an acceptable practice, but again, only do so if necessary.  Similar to your approach with the title, keep the code snippets as concise as possible, using only the lines that are necessary for the reader to reproduce the problem.  Quality over quantity!</p> 

			<h3>How Should Your Question Look?</h3>
			
			<p>Short answer: PROFESSIONAL!</p>

			<p>So at this point, you know who your question is for, and what information it should contain, so you're most of the way there.  Now you need to consider the "appearance" of your question, and no, I'm not referring to it's hair color or muscle definition.</p>

			<p>You're a professional now, and the days of using funky run-on sentences or having typos in your writing are hopefully few and far between.  As a developer, you know that anyone can view your work at any time, and your work is your face in the online world.  Your attention to detail in formatting questions on help sites is no different from the effort you would put into creating your own blog.  Your writing should be free of typos and grammatical errors.  To be safe, have someone proof-read your question before you post (if you doubt your own editing abilities).  Use bold/underline/italic styling in proper places, but don't abuse them!  Extra punctuation can also appear very unprofessional, so refrain from using multiple exclamation points or questions marks to show your enthusiasm!!!!!!!</p>

			<h3>After You've Posted</h3>

			<p>Now that you have all the makings for a first-class question, what next?  After you've posted it for all the world to see, you'll obviously be looking for a response, which may or may not come at all.  In the event it does, use the same guidelines you just read about in responding to those helping you.  Your feedback to them should be timely, and of course gracious.  If they offer any criticism, take it as constructive and not personal.  Reading emotions through writing can be difficult in any situation, and even more so on a technical site.</p>

			<p>And please don't forget the most important rule of question asking:</p>
			<p><strong>Don't be afraid to ask!</strong> </p>
