					<h2>Web Page Critic!</h2>
				<br>
				<br>
		<p>During the first week of Phase 0, each of us were challenged to assess three of our favorite websites in terms of design and user experience.  The sites I chose to review were:</p>
				<br>
		<h3>Trulia</h3>
		  <img src = "http://oi57.tinypic.com/ruskjt.jpg" height=300 width=450/>
		  <br></br>
		  <p>For anyone who has been frustrated when trying to find a new place to live, Trulia is a gift from God.  The site pairs listing information with property images to provide the renter/buyer with a smorgasbord of new living choices.  The main search box and menu bar across the top instantly grab your attention, and provide a great starting point for your search.  
		  <p>Visually, I would describe this site as: appealing, modern, concise, simple, and clear.  While the visuals rock, the site continues to impress with its content focus, which is efficient, intuitive, and consistent. </p>
		  <p>All of this makes the site a shopper's dream, with easy to navigate options and content.  After using Trulia, you'll not only feel informed, but satisfied and a little excited (if you found the right property)! I personally have used Trulia to focus my property searches, and encourage you to as well.</p>
		  <p>------------------------</p>

		<h3>Skillcrush</h3>
		  <img src = "http://oi62.tinypic.com/2ynfog9.jpg" height=300 width=450/>
		  <br></br>
		  <p>Skillcrush is one my faves as well, but not necessarily becuase I use it that frequently.  I enjoy this site because its sybolizes cutting-edge web design.</p>
		  <p>When the page first loads, you're quickly aware of the expertise involved in its design.  The fonts, images, and clean look are instantly engaging.</p>
		  <p>Its main purpose is to offer training/classes to aspiring web developers and designers.  However, you need not purchase the programs to feel motivated to enhance your web skills - just look at the site!  Not only is the content clear and organized, but the modern and bold visual features of the pages make you WANT to explore.  The interface is quite intuitive, and you'll find yourself effortlessly following the appropriate links as you search for information.</p>
		  <p>If the success of a webpage's design is attributed to how a user feels after their visit, then slap 5 stars on this bad-boy.  Once I click "close" in the top left corner I feel very satisifed.  But more importantly, I feel EXCITED to crank out some ferocious code!</p>
		  <p>----------------</p>

		<h3>RealClearPolitics</h3>
		  <img src = "http://oi60.tinypic.com/2u6z94z.jpg" height=300 width=450/>
		  <br></br>
		  <p>The final page I chose to review was that of RealClearPolitics.  While it is hardly a stunning visual, it serves its purpose efficiently.  For any news/politics buffs out there, you know how convenient it is to see similar editorials/news articles grouped together all in one site. Enter: RCP.</p>
		  <p>When loading the site, you'll first look to the main sidebard on the left side of the homepage.  Here, you'll see the more popular news items of the day, grouped together by category (perfect if you're in a hurry).  In the content area, you'll see an extensive list of editorials which are organized according to the time of day they were released: morning, afternoon, evening.</p>
		  <p>Visually, RCP is less than stellar.  It has a predictable layout, with a fairly plain and simple design scheme.  With that said, RCP's purpose isn't to amaze you with effects, but succeed in getting you INFORMATION.  The content focus is practical, diverse, and prioritized.  The chronological grouping makes it very easy to track the latest updates to current events, and you'll soon realize there aren't enough hours in the day to digest all of this info!  After leaving RCP, the content will leave you feeling informed and educated, but the visuals will have you reaching for a bottle of visine...</p>
